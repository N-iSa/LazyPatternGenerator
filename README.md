# LazyPatternGenerator
I'm lazy and wanted a tool that does most of the work for me.

# How it works:
1. Create a template in the folder "templates"
2. Start the tool
3. Insert your variables
4. Chose a template
5. Press the Button. Don't worry, i'll make it red. Everyone wants to press a red button.
6. Your files will be in the folder "Output"

# How the template works
It needs a file-name. You set the name within "<Filename></Filename>".
"<FOREACH></FOREACH>" indicates that everything inside the tag should be done for every GroupElement.
The Tags <KEY> and <TYPE> can only be used inside the <FOREACH>-Tag
